# JasperGreen
Webpage designed for my capstone project while attending Texas A&amp;M. The purpose of this project was to create a webpage for a lawn care company that goes by Jasper Green.
It is a webpage that allows for the management of all important data that Jasper Green collects. It allows for the adding, editing, and deleting of any bits of data that the admin chooses.

This project was done in three two-week sprints. I tried my hardest, as I was working alone, and I think I gained some valuable insight into how web development 
works. The work was difficult, but it's helped me grow and learn more about MVC development, as well as what I can do when I put my mind to it. The webpage has some problems
but I figured it is important to show the mistakes I may have made along the way.

If you use Visual Studio for this code (like I did), please use the NuGet Package Manager Console and add a migration, and then update the database.
It would look something like this:
                                    add-migration initial
                                    update-database
Run these two commands separately.
